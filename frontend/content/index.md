## About

A Repository of Knowledge. Currently focused on data gathering.

Â© 2022 Victor Fisher

## Methodology

Assemble a large collection of nodes in pure markdown. Everything else including databases, statistics, metadata, user interface, testing, type checking, searching and cataloging should be considered a higher level of abstraction and therefore of a less critical value. Scale the data itself rather than the infrastructure. The interconnections are what matter, but they naturally arise from throwing it all together.

## Outline

Expand some general topics to article nodes which will be the atomic element. The general topics will become relations or edges. I need to come up with a controlled vocabulary or thesaurus of terms, codes, or definitions in the system. It will be self documenting.
